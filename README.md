# Design patterns

As Wikipedia states "in software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system."

They are divided in 3 sub-categories: 
* Creational patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way 
* Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality
* Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
