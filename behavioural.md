# Chain of responsibility [\^](#index)

## Description
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## The problem
Our application needs to mock how an ATM machine works. Our application tells us how many bills for a given money amount must be given.

Initially, only 100 and 50 € bills are emitted, so it's pretty simple. A couple of `if` should do. But, then I'm adding 20 € bills, and from a couple of `if` we get a lot a branching instructions. When I'm adding 10 € bills the complexity explodes.

Another example of CoR pattern is the SpringBoot interceptor logic and Java native try-multicatch block.

## The solution
The chain of responsibility pattern comes to help, because it transforms particular behaviours in stand-alone objects called handlers - passing the request along the chain along with its data.

Let's start by defining the `AbstracHandler` interface, which has a method that set the next handler and a method that dispense bills:

```java
public interface AbstracHandler {

	void setNextHandler(final AbstracHandler nextHandler);

	void dispense(final int money);

}
```

And all the hanlders, where the 100 € one will be the first:

```java
public class HoundredEuroHandler implements AbstracHandler {

	private AbstracHandler nextHandler;

	@Override
	public void setNextHandler(final AbstracHandler nextHandler) {
		this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
	}

	@Override
	public void dispense(final int money) {
		if (money >= 100) {
			final int num = money / 100;
			final int remainder = money % 100;
			System.out.println("Dispensing " + num + " 100€ bill");
			if (remainder != 0) {
				this.nextHandler.dispense(remainder);
			}
		} else {
			this.nextHandler.dispense(money);
		}
	}

}
```

```java
public class FiftyEuroHandler implements AbstracHandler {

	private AbstracHandler nextHandler;

	@Override
	public void setNextHandler(final AbstracHandler nextHandler) {
		this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
	}

	@Override
	public void dispense(final int money) {
		if (money >= 50) {
			final int num = money / 50;
			final int remainder = money % 50;
			System.out.println("Dispensing " + num + " 50€ bill");
			if (remainder != 0) {
				this.nextHandler.dispense(remainder);
			}
		} else {
			this.nextHandler.dispense(money);
		}
	}

}
```

```java
public class TwentyEuroHandler implements AbstracHandler {

	private AbstracHandler nextHandler;

	@Override
	public void setNextHandler(final AbstracHandler nextHandler) {
		this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
	}

	@Override
	public void dispense(final int money) {
		if (money >= 20) {
			final int num = money / 20;
			final int remainder = money % 20;
			System.out.println("Dispensing " + num + " 20€ bill");
			if (remainder != 0) {
				this.nextHandler.dispense(remainder);
			}
		} else {
			this.nextHandler.dispense(money);
		}
	}

}
```

```java
public class TenEuroHandler implements AbstracHandler {

	@Override
	public void setNextHandler(final AbstracHandler nextHandler) {
		//
	}

	@Override
	public void dispense(final int money) {
		final int num = money / 10;
		System.out.println("Dispensing " + num + " 10€ bill");
	}

}
```

Our application will then create the chain:
```java
final HoundredEuroHandler houndred = new HoundredEuroHandler();
		final FiftyEuroHandler fifty = new FiftyEuroHandler();
		final TwentyEuroHandler twenty = new TwentyEuroHandler();
		final TenEuroHandler ten = new TenEuroHandler();
		houndred.setNextHandler(fifty);
		fifty.setNextHandler(twenty);
		twenty.setNextHandler(ten);
```

And call it from the first handler:
```java
houndred.dispense(280);
```
which displays:
```
Dispensing 2 100€ bill(s)
Dispensing 1 50€ bill(s)
Dispensing 1 20€ bill(s)
Dispensing 1 10€ bill(s)
```

Another example:
```java
houndred.dispense(130);
```
which displays:
```
Dispensing 1 100€ bill(s)
Dispensing 1 20€ bill(s)
Dispensing 1 10€ bill(s)
```

Why is this cool? Beacause every handler decides itself to emit the bill or pass along the chain. 
In the first example all of the handlers are called, while in the second handlers that cannot handle the amount (50 € bill handler) simply pass along the chain the request.

## Pros and Cons

**\+** the order of handling can be controlled

**\+** decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform operations

**\+** new handlers can be introduced easily

**\-** some request may be not handled

## When to use

- there is the need to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are
unknown
- the order of handlers is critical to be in a given order
- the order of handlers can change at runtime
